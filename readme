This calculator has the function to be a classic calculator as a vertical orientation and a scientific calculator 
when it is at a horizontal orientation.

 Main Activity, has  fields that correlate to buttons on XML. It has a method that evaluates our XML button inputs. 
 Main Activity, also evaluates a conditional that looks for a clicker selecting our inverse button and it will work appropriately.

I have also incorporated  ExtendedDoubleEvaluator class that extends from the Javaluator libraries' Double Evaluator class. I have inputed 
factorial and sqrt operators to give functions to these buttons on XML.

Buttons receive their functions from the Double Evaluator class, taken rom the Javaluator library.

I have implemented the Javaluator library into our dependency in the gradle.
